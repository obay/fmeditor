# fmeditor

This command line is created to help me convert all markdown files I have to be Hugo friendly. Hugo requires that you include frontmatter at the top of your markdown.

This command currently goes through all *.md files and adds the required YAML lines to the top of the md file. Future versions will allow for editing specific attributes of the frontmatter in builk.
