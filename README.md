Frontmatter Editor is a command line created to help me convert all markdown files to be Hugo friendly format. Hugo requires that you include frontmatter at the top of your markdown posts.

This command currently goes through all *.md files in a given folder and adds the required YAML lines to the top of the md file. Future versions will allow for editing specific attributes of the frontmatter in bulk.
